# 🐆 itsmejeremyd.com - Gatsby Edition 🐆

This is a port of my portfolio to Gatsby. Eventually it will replace the current static site, and the development experience will be more streamlined (with regards to future features and deployments).

My learning goals are as follows:

1. **Recreate my static HTML site in Gatsby**

    This will give me some more experience using React, while letting me work with a static site generator, server-side rendering, and performance considerations, all while building a showcase for my future (and some past) work.

1. **Work with unit and integration testing**

    I recently attended a workshop at HackerYou on testing React applications with Jest. While some of the content was beyond what we had covered in the bootcamp, it shined a light on where I was weak, and concepts that I needed to explore.

1. **Refactor the design and css**

    We only had a week to take a rough design and prep it for Industry Day. There are some usability issues, things that could be built out as components, and features that I just didn't have time to figure out.
