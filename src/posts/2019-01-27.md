# CSS Specificity

Something I first struggled with when I became a Web Developer was the concept of specificity. So what better way to start my blogging debut with a difficult concept that is difficult to pronounce?

## What happens when style rules conflict?

The first thing we should try and clear up is how one styling rule is favoured over another. This is only ever needed when an element is targeted by multiple style declarations. When there are two styling rules that conflict with each other (for example: both rules try to change the background colour of a div) each rule is compared to find out which is more specific than the other. The browser does this by counting each of the elements in the selector, and generates three numbers in the form of x-y-z.

## Group X

This is the number of ID selectors. Since we can only declare one unique ID per page, it makes sense that using an ID as a selector

## Group Y

The sum of all class selectors, attribute selectors and pseudo-classes.

## Group Z

The total of element selectors and pseudo-elements

## Some Quick Examples:

```
div {} /* One element: 0-0-1 */
.dogs {} /* One class: 0-1-0 */
#myButton {} /* One ID: 1-0-0 */
p .dogs {} /* One element, one class: 0-1-1 */
.dogs .cats {} /* Two classes: 0-2-0 */
```

Some Quick Examples:

```
div {} /* One element: 0-0-1 */
.dogs {} /* One class: 0-1-0 */
#myButton {} /* One ID: 1-0-0 */
p .dogs {} /* One element, one class: 0-1-1 */
.dogs .cats {} /* Two classes: 0-2-0 */
```

The Comparison
Now that we’ve established weights for each of the selectors, we then need to compare them to see which style rules will overwrite the other. This is fairly straightforward: moving left to right compare the numbers to each other, with the higher value taking precedence.

0-2-0 is more specific than 0-1-0
We also only move on to the next number if there is a tie

0-2-1 is more specific than 0-2-0
Note that there isn’t a point where a large number on the right beats a smaller number on the left.

0-1-0 is more specific than 0-0-99
!important and inline styles
It should be noted that using the !important keyword will set a specificity of 1–0–0–0–0. This is considered bad practice, as there is potential for misuse and is generally suggested to take another look at your overall methodology if you are considering using it.

Inline styles (with a specificity of 1–0–0–0) could also cause problems if not used correctly. Refer to the MDN article linked below for best practices for each of these situations.

Quickly checking the weighting
If you use VS Code, just mouse over the selector and it will show you a tooltip with the selector specificity.
